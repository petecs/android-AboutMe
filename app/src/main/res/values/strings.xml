        Hi, my name is Peter.
        \n\nI am a programmer and computer scientist who loves everything about programming.
        \n\nThe different programming languages I know include Python, C, C++, C#, Java, Swift, and several others.
        \n\nProgramming is actually a fun and relaxing activity for me, even when I run into frustrating bugs!
        \n\nWhen I am not programming I also enjoy playing the guitar and working out.
        \n\nThanks for checking out my app!\n\n</string>
